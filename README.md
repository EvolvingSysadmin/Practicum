# Cybersecurity Policy Templates

This project aims to simplify the complex cybersecurity challenges faced by small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) by providing free access to [policy templates](/pages/instructions/instructions.md), [implementation instructions](/pages/implementation/implementation.md), and [policy collaboration](/pages/collaboration/collaboration.md).

## Policy Templates

Developing policies that align with cybersecurity frameworks can be costly and time-consuming for small businesses. This project provides 36 free [cybersecurity policy templates](/pages/instructions/instructions.md) and [implementation instructions](/pages/implementation/implementation.md) to relieve SMBs from the need to purchase policies, hire consultants, or dedicate significant resources to policy creation. Although not designed to fully meet every compliance requirement, these templates follow the [NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 (NSIT CSF 2.0)](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework) core functions of [Govern](pages/govern/govern.md), [Identify](pages/identify/identify.md), [Protect](pages/protect/protect.md), [Detect](pages/detect/detect.md), [Respond](pages/respond/respond.md), and [Recover](pages/recover/).

## Instructions

This site serves as a comprehensive resource for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) to develop and implement effective cybersecurity policies. Users can download 36 policy templates aligned with each NIST CSF 2.0 Core Function. Download specific templates and follow these [step-by-step instructions](/pages/instructions/instructions.md) to complete and modify the documents to meet your organization's needs. Users can also find tips on [how to implement the policies](/pages/implementation/implementation.md) after completing the templates. Users are also encouraged to [contribute to the project](/pages/collaboration/collaboration.md) by sharing updated policy templates and resources.

## Dire Landscape

Small business cybersecurity statistics paint a stark picture, underscoring the critical and immediate need for SMBs to fortify their cybersecurity strategies or risk becoming prime targets for increasingly sophisticated and damaging cyberattacks.

## NIST Cybersecurity Framework

Small businesses don’t need to reinvent the wheel to enhance their cybersecurity. Small businesses can enhance their cybersecurity by adopting [established cybersecurity frameworks](/pages/framework/framework.md) that provide structured approaches for identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and mitigating cybersecurity risks. These frameworks enable small businesses to implement standardized practices and build resilience, even when IT resources are limited. Prominent framework providers include the [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://www.nist.gov/cybersecurity), [International Organization for Standardization (ISO)](https://iso.org/sectors/it-technologies/information-security), and the [Center for Internet Security (CIS)](https://www.cisecurity.org). However, these frameworks can be complex, which is why this project aims to simplify their adoption for small businesses.

The [NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0](/pages/framework/framework.md) offers voluntary guidance for organizations of all sizes to understand, assess, and communicate their cybersecurity efforts. It is adaptable, allowing organizations to consider their unique risk tolerances and priorities. NIST, a U.S. government agency, develops widely recognized standards that many sectors and governments adopt to strengthen their cybersecurity posture, fostering consistency and trust across industries in the fight against cybercrime.

## Policies and Standards

[Cybersecurity policies](/pages/instructions/instructions.md) are the foundation of any effective cybersecurity program, translating broad strategies from frameworks into actionable processes. Well-defined and implemented policies establish accountability, streamline decision-making, and ensure consistent responses to cybersecurity incidents, minimizing the risk of human error. Cybersecurity standards, on the other hand, provide specific, detailed, and measurable requirements for how cybersecurity practices should be implemented.

While policies define the overall goals and expectations, standards offer clear, actionable criteria to meet those objectives. Policies are strategic and flexible, whereas standards are more technical and prescriptive, focusing on the "how" and "what" of cybersecurity controls. Together, they ensure both high-level direction and practical execution.
