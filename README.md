# Cybersecurity Policy Templates

This project aims to simplify the complex cybersecurity challenges faced by small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) by providing free access to [policy templates](pages/overview/template-overview.md), [implementation guides](pages/guides/guides.md), and [resources](pages/resources/resources.md).

## Policy Templates

Developing policies that align with cybersecurity frameworks can be costly and time-consuming for small businesses. This project provides [free cybersecurity policy templates](pages/overview/template-overview.md), [implementation guides](pages/guides/guides.md), and [resources](pages/resources/resources.md) to relieve SMBs from the need to purchase policies, hire consultants, or dedicate significant resources to policy creation. Although not designed to fully meet every compliance requirement, these templates follow the [NIST Cyberscurity Framework 2.0 (NSIT CSF 2.0)](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework) core functions of [Govern](pages/govern/govern.md), [Identify](pages/identify/identify.md), [Protect](pages/protect/protect.md), [Detect](pages/detect/detect.md), [Respond](pages/respond/respond.md), and [Recover](pages/recover/)

## Statistics

The small business cybersecurity statistics paint a stark picture, underscoring the critical and immediate need for SMBs to fortify their cybersecurity strategies or risk becoming prime targets for increasingly sophisticated and damaging cyberattacks.

## Usage

This website is a comprehensive resource for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) to develop and implement effective cybersecurity policies. It offers [free policy templates](https://docs.policytemplates.online/policy-templates/template-overview), [implementation guides](https://docs.policytemplates.online/policy-implementation/guides), and [resources](https://docs.policytemplates.online/policy-resources/resources) to simplify the complex process of implementing a cybersecurity program. Whether  starting from scratch or enhancing existing policies, users can find step-by-step guidance aligned with best practices like the [NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0](https://docs.policytemplates.online/policy-framework/framework). These resources help SMBs strengthen their cybersecurity posture in an increasingly risky digital landscape.

## Frameworks

Small businesses don’t need to reinvent the wheel to enhance their cybersecurity. Instead, SMBs can adopt [existing cybersecurity frameworks](pages/resources/frameworks.md) that offer clear, structured approaches for identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and mitigating cybersecurity risks. These frameworks enable small businesses to implement standardized practices, build resilience, and maintain trust with customers and partners, even when IT resources are limited. Prominent cybersecurity framework providers include the [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://www.nist.gov/cybersecurity), [International Organization for Standardization (ISO)](https://iso.org/sectors/it-technologies/information-security), and the [Center for Internet Security (CIS)](https://www.cisecurity.org). While these frameworks are effective, they can also be complex and challenging to implement. This project aims to simplify that process, offering small businesses a practical starting point for adopting a cybersecurity program based on existing frameworks.

## NIST Cybsercurity Framework

The [NIST Cybersecurity Framework CSF 2.0](/pages/framework/framework.md) is voluntary guidance that helps organizations—regardless of size, sector, or maturity—better understand, assess, prioritize, and communicate their cybersecurity efforts. The Framework is not a one-size-fits-all approach to managing cybersecurity risks. This supplement and the full CSF 2.0 can help organizations to consider and record their own risk tolerances, priorities, threats, vulnerabilities, and requirements which, in turn, helps those organizations establish a structured, scalable, and adaptable cybersecurity program, which is crucial for staying ahead in today's dynamic threat landscape.

The [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://www.nist.gov/cybersecurity) is a U.S. government agency that plays a critical role in advancing technology, including cybersecurity. NIST develops widely recognized standards and guidelines that help organizations protect their information systems from cyber threats. Its influence extends globally, as many industries and government agencies adopt NIST's best practices to improve their cybersecurity posture. NIST's work fosters consistency, reliability, and trust across sectors, making it a cornerstone in the fight against cybercrime.

## Policies

[Cybersecurity policies](/pages/overview/template-overview.md) form the foundation of any effective cybersecurity program. While frameworks outline the broad strategies for managing risks, policies specify how these strategies are applied and enforced within a business. Together, frameworks and policies create a cohesive system that enhances a business’s overall cybersecurity posture. By translating the framework’s guidelines into actionable processes, policies help ensure that employees understand their roles and responsibilities in maintaining security. Well-defined and implemented policies establish accountability, streamline decision-making, and ensure consistent responses to cybersecurity incidents, minimizing the risk of human error.
