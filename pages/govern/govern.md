# Govern

## Summary

The [NIST CSF 2.0](/pages/framework/framework.md) Govern core function ensures that a small Business's cybersecurity risk management strategy, expectations, and policy are established, communicated, and monitored.

## Background

The Govern function provides insights to help prioritize and achieve the outcomes of the other five Functions in line with the organization’s mission and stakeholder expectations. Governance activities are essential for integrating cybersecurity into the broader enterprise risk management (ERM) strategy. The Govern function encompasses understanding the organizational context, establishing the cybersecurity strategy and supply chain risk management, defining roles and responsibilities, creating policies, and overseeing cybersecurity initiatives.

## Policy Templates

### Information Security Policy

* **Description**: The Information Security Policy establishes the minimum mandatory requirements for information security within the organization. While organizations can exceed these requirements based on specific business needs and legal obligations, they must meet the baseline standards set forth in this policy.
* **Word Template Link**: [Information-Security-Policy.docx](https://github.com/EvolvingSysadmin/Practicum/raw/refs/heads/main/templates/govern/Information-Security-Policy.docx)
* **Primary NIST CSF 2.0 Category**: [Policy](#policy)

### Acceptable Use of Information Technology Resources Policy

* **Description**: The Acceptable Use of Information Technology Resources Policy outlines the proper use of information and technology resources within the organization, emphasizing the importance of workforce participation and support for effective security. Inappropriate usage can lead to significant risks, including ransomware attacks, system compromises, and legal issues.
* **Word Template Link:** [Acceptable-Use-of-Information-Technology-Resources-Policy.docx](https://github.com/EvolvingSysadmin/Practicum/raw/refs/heads/main/templates/govern/Acceptable-Use-of-Information-Technology-Resources-Policy.docx)
* **Primary NIST CSF 2.0 Category**: [Policy](#policy)

### Planning Policy

* **Description**: The Planning Policy ensures that IT resources and information systems are established with effective security controls and control enhancements that reflect applicable federal and state laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance.
* **Word Template Link**: [Planning-Policy.docx](https://github.com/EvolvingSysadmin/Practicum/raw/refs/heads/main/templates/govern/Planning-Policy.docx)
* **Primary NIST CSF 2.0 Category**: [Oversight](#oversight)

### Personnel Security Policy

* **Description**: The Personnel Security Policy ensures that safeguards are implemented for personnel access to and use of information technology resources and data. This policy establishes protocols to verify the trustworthiness of personnel, mitigating risks related to insider threats and ensuring that only authorized individuals have access to sensitive information. It is crucial for protecting the organization’s information assets and maintaining overall security.

* **Primary NIST CSF 2.0 Category**: [Roles, Responsibilities, and Authorities](#roles-responsibilities-and-authorities)

### Systems and Services Acquisition Policy

* **Description**: The System and Services Acquisition Policy ensures that Information Technology resources and information systems are acquired with security requirements to meet the information systems mission and business objectives.
* **Document Link**: [Systems-and-Services-Acquisition-Policy.docx](https://github.com/EvolvingSysadmin/Practicum/raw/refs/heads/main/templates/protect/Systems-and-Services-Acquisition-Policy.docx)
* **NIST CSF 2.0 Category**: [Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management](#cybersecurity-supply-chain-risk-management)

### Information Security Risk Management Standard

* **Description**: The Information Security Risk Management Standard is vital for identifying, analyzing, and maintaining acceptable levels of risk to confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Regular risk assessments enable management to prioritize the most critical information assets, supporting informed decision-making. Compliance with federal and state mandates requires routine assessments to identify risks and implement necessary controls. Addressing security risks early is more cost-effective than dealing with incidents later. This standard provides a framework for evaluating the current security posture, identifying gaps, and determining appropriate actions.
