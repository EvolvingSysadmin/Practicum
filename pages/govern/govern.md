# Govern

The Govern function ensures that a small Business's cybersecurity risk management strategy, expectations, and policy are established, communicated, and monitored

## Background

The organization’s cybersecurity risk management strategy, expectations, and policy are established, communicated, and monitored. The Govenr function provides outcomes to inform what an organization may do to achieve and prioritize the outcomes of the other five Functions in the context of its mission and stakeholder expectations. Governance activities are critical for incorporating cybersecurity into an organization’s broader enterprise risk management (ERM) strategy. GOVERN addresses an understanding of organizational context; the establishment of cybersecurity strategy and cybersecurity supply chain risk management; roles, responsibilities, and authorities; policy; and the oversight of cybersecurity strategy.
