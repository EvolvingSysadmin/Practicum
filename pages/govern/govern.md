# Govern

The Govern function ensures that a small Business's cybersecurity risk management strategy, expectations, and policy are established, communicated, and monitored

## Background

The organization’s cybersecurity risk management strategy, expectations, and policy are established, communicated, and monitored. The Govenr function provides outcomes to inform what an organization may do to achieve and prioritize the outcomes of the other five Functions in the context of its mission and stakeholder expectations. Governance activities are critical for incorporating cybersecurity into an organization’s broader enterprise risk management (ERM) strategy. GOVERN addresses an understanding of organizational context; the establishment of cybersecurity strategy and cybersecurity supply chain risk management; roles, responsibilities, and authorities; policy; and the oversight of cybersecurity strategy.

## Policy Templates

### Information Security Policy

* **Description**: This policy defines the mandatory minimum information security requirements for the entity as defined below in Section 3.0 Scope. Any entity may, based on its individual business needs and specific legal and federal requirements, exceed the security requirements put forth in this document, but must, at a minimum, achieve the security levels required by this policy.

* **Govern Category**: *Policy*

### Acceptable Use of Information Technology Resourcess Policy

* **Description**: Appropriate organizational use of information and information technology (“IT”) resources and effective security of those resources require the participation and support of the organization’s workforce (“users”).  Inappropriate use exposes the organization to potential risks including virus attacks, compromise of network systems and services, and legal issues.

### Information Security Risk Management Standard

* **Description**: Risk management is a critical component of any information security program.  It helps ensure that any risk to confidentiality, integrity, and availability is identified, analyzed, and maintained at acceptable levels.  Risk assessments allow management to prioritize and focus on areas that pose the greatest impact to critical and sensitive information assets. This provides the foundation for informed decision-making regarding information security. Federal and State mandates require routine assessments to identify risk and ensure appropriate controls. Risk assessments allow alignment of information security with business objectives and regulatory requirements. Identifying information security risk and considering control requirements from the onset is essential, and far less costly than retrofitting or addressing the impact of a security incident. This standard provides a risk management framework to evaluate current security posture, identify gaps, and determine appropriate actions.
