# Protect

## Summary

The [NIST CSF 2.0](/pages/framework/framework.md) Protect core function encompasses safeguards designed to limit or contain the impact of potential cybersecurity events. This proactive approach focuses on implementing security controls to safeguard critical infrastructure.

## Background

Safeguards to manage the organization’s cybersecurity risks are used. Once assets and risks are identified and prioritized, the Protect function supports the ability to secure those assets to prevent or lower the likelihood and impact of adverse cybersecurity events, as well as to increase the likelihood and impact of taking advantage of opportunities. Outcomes covered by this Function include identity management, authentication, and access control; awareness and training; data security; platform security (i.e., securing the hardware, software, and services of physical and virtual platforms); and the resilience of technology infrastructure.
