# Protect

Download free policy and standard templates for the [NIST CSF 2.0](/pages/framework/framework.md) Protect Core Function, which focuses on proactive safeguards designed to limit or contain the impact of potential cybersecurity events.

## Protect Function Background

The Protect Function defines the necessary safeguards to manage an organization’s cybersecurity risks. After identifying and prioritizing assets and risks, this function focuses on securing those assets to reduce the likelihood and impact of adverse cybersecurity events while enhancing opportunities for success. Key outcomes of the Protect function include identity management, authentication, and access control; security awareness and training; data protection; platform security (securing hardware, software, and services for both physical and virtual platforms); and the resilience of technology infrastructure.
