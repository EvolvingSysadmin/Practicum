# NIST CSF 2.0 Framework

## Background

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 provides guidance to industry, government agencies, and other organizations to manage cybersecurity risks. It offers a taxonomy of highlevel cybersecurity outcomes that can be used by any organization — regardless of its size, sector, or maturity — to better understand, assess, prioritize, and communicate its cybersecurity efforts.

## CSF 2.0 Core

The CSF 2.0 Core is the nucleus of the CSF, which is a taxonomy of high-level cybersecurity outcomes that can help any organization manage its cybersecurity risks. The CSF Core
components are a hierarchy of Functions, Categories, and Subcategories that detail each outcome.

These outcomes can be understood by a broad audience, including executives, managers, and practitioners, regardless of their cybersecurity expertise. Because the outcomes are sector-, country-, and technology-neutral, they provide an organization with the flexibility needed to address its unique risks, technologies, and mission considerations.

The CSF Core Functions — Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover — organize cybersecurity outcomes at their highest level. A more detailed description of each Core Function can be found below.

### Govern

The Govern Core Function helps ensure the organization’s cybersecurity risk management strategy, expectations, and policy are established, communicated, and monitored.

The Govern Function provides outcomes to inform what an organization may do to achieve and prioritize the outcomes of the other five Functions in the context of its mission and stakeholder expectations. Governance activities are critical for incorporating cybersecurity into an organization’s broader enterprise risk management (ERM) strategy. Govern addresses an understanding of organizational context; the establishment of cybersecurity strategy and cybersecurity supply chain risk management; roles, responsibilities, and authorities; policy; and the oversight of cybersecurity strategy.

### Identify

The Identify Core Function helps ensure the organization’s current cybersecurity risks are understood.

Understanding the organization’s assets (e.g., data, hardware, software, systems, facilities, services, people), suppliers, and related cybersecurity risks enables an organization to prioritize its efforts consistent with its risk management strategy and the mission needs identified under Govern. This Function also includes the identification of improvement opportunities for the organization’s policies, plans, processes, procedures, and practices that support cybersecurity risk management to inform efforts under all six Functions.

### Protect

The Protect Core Function helps safeguard to manage the organization’s cybersecurity risks are used.

Once assets and risks are identified and prioritized, Protect supports the ability to secure those assets to prevent or lower the likelihood and impact of adverse cybersecurity events, as well as to increase the likelihood and impact of taking advantage of opportunities. Outcomes covered by this Function include identity management, authentication, and access control; awareness and training; data security; platform security (i.e., securing the hardware, software, and services of physical and virtual platforms); and the resilience of technology infrastructure.

### Detect

The Detect Core Function helps ensure that possible cybersecurity attacks and compromises are found and analyzed

Detect enables the timely discovery and analysis of anomalies, indicators of compromise, and other potentially adverse events that may indicate that cybersecurity attacks and incidents are occurring. This Function supports successful incident response and recovery activities.

### Respond

The Respond Core Function helps ensure that actions regarding a detected cybersecurity incident are taken.

Respond supports the ability to contain the effects of cybersecurity incidents. Outcomes within this Function cover incident management, analysis, mitigation, reporting, and communication.

### Recover

The Recover Core Function helps ensure that assets and operations affected by a cybersecurity incident are restored.

Recover supports the timely restoration of normal operations to reduce the effects of cybersecurity incidents and enable appropriate communication during recovery efforts.
