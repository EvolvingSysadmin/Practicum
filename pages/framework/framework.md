# NIST CSF 2.0 Framework

The [NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework) provides guidance to industry, government agencies, and other organizations to manage cybersecurity risks. It offers a structured set of high-level cybersecurity outcomes that can be used by any organization—regardless of its size, sector, or maturity—to better understand, assess, prioritize, and communicate its cybersecurity efforts.

## Benefits

Using policies that loosely follow the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 offers numerous benefits for organizations-especially Small and Medium Sized Businesses-that want to align with cybersecurity best practices but need flexibility. Here are some key advantages:

* [x] [Risk Management](#risk-management)
* [x] [Adaptive to Threats](#adaptive-to-threats)
* [x] [Communication and Accountability](#communication-and-accountability)
* [x] [Scalability](#scalability)
* [x] [Industry Standards](#industry-standards)
* [X] [Regulatory Readiness](#regulatory-readiness)

### Risk Management

SMBs can use the framework to understand their unique risks and develop security policies without needing a large security team or a complex, resource-intensive risk management process.

SMBs can adopt only the most relevant parts of the framework, optimizing their security posture while keeping costs down.

### Adaptive to Threats

SMBs benefit from a framework that is easy to adjust as cybersecurity threats evolve, allowing them to stay protected without frequent overhauls of their security strategy. As SMBs adopt new technologies or migrate to the cloud, the framework’s adaptability ensures that their security policies can evolve in parallel.

### Communication and Accountability

For SMBs where cybersecurity expertise may be limited, the NIST CSF’s clear language fosters better communication between technical staff and management, helping everyone understand the risks and measures. It helps assign roles and responsibilities within the organization, clarifying who is responsible for specific security measures and reducing confusion.

### Scalability

SMBs often have limited budgets and personnel dedicated to cybersecurity. The framework's flexibility allows them to implement the most critical functions first and scale up gradually as resources permit. By focusing initially on the essential parts of the framework (e.g., Govern, Identify, and Protect), SMBs can lay a foundation for cybersecurity without overwhelming their teams.

### Industry Standards

Even with a loose alignment, SMBs benefit from implementing widely accepted best practices that improve credibility with customers, partners, and regulators. Aligning with the NIST CSF allows SMBs to transition to other frameworks like ISO 27001 or comply with sector-specific standards as they grow, without having to start from scratch.

### Regulatory Readiness

SMBs may need to meet basic regulatory requirements, and loosely following NIST CSF helps them prepare for this without going all-in on a more formal (and potentially costly) compliance framework. Demonstrating alignment with recognized frameworks like NIST CSF can help during audits, providing evidence that the business is taking security seriously.

## CSF 2.0 Core

The CSF 2.0 Core is the nucleus of the CSF, which is a taxonomy of high-level cybersecurity outcomes that can help any organization manage its cybersecurity risks. The CSF Core
components are a hierarchy of Functions, Categories, and Subcategories that detail each outcome.

![CSF 2.0 Core, Categories, and Subcategories Relationship](/img/nist-csf-2-core-relationships.png)

These outcomes can be understood by a broad audience, including executives, managers, and practitioners, regardless of their cybersecurity expertise. Because the outcomes are sector-, country-, and technology-neutral, they provide an organization with the flexibility needed to address its unique risks, technologies, and mission considerations.

The CSF Core Functions — Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover — organize cybersecurity outcomes at their highest level. A more detailed description of each Core Function can be found below.

### Govern

The [Govern Core Function](/pages/govern/govern.md) helps ensure the organization’s cybersecurity risk management strategy, expectations, and policy are established, communicated, and monitored. The Govern Function provides outcomes to inform what an organization may do to achieve and prioritize the outcomes of the other five Functions in the context of its mission and stakeholder expectations. Governance activities are critical for incorporating cybersecurity into an organization’s broader enterprise risk management (ERM) strategy. Govern addresses an understanding of organizational context; the establishment of cybersecurity strategy and cybersecurity supply chain risk management; roles, responsibilities, and authorities; policy; and the oversight of cybersecurity strategy.

### Identify

The [Identify Core Function](/pages/identify/identify.md) helps ensure the organization’s current cybersecurity risks are understood. Understanding the organization’s assets (e.g., data, hardware, software, systems, facilities, services, people), suppliers, and related cybersecurity risks enables an organization to prioritize its efforts consistent with its risk management strategy and the mission needs identified under Govern. This Function also includes the identification of improvement opportunities for the organization’s policies, plans, processes, procedures, and practices that support cybersecurity risk management to inform efforts under all six Functions.

### Protect

The [Protect Core Function](/pages/protect/protect.md) helps safeguard to manage the organization’s cybersecurity risks are used. Once assets and risks are identified and prioritized, Protect supports the ability to secure those assets to prevent or lower the likelihood and impact of adverse cybersecurity events, as well as to increase the likelihood and impact of taking advantage of opportunities. Outcomes covered by this Function include identity management, authentication, and access control; awareness and training; data security; platform security (i.e., securing the hardware, software, and services of physical and virtual platforms); and the resilience of technology infrastructure.

### Detect

The [Detect Core Function](/pages/detect/detect.md) helps ensure that possible cybersecurity attacks and compromises are found and analyzed Detect enables the timely discovery and analysis of anomalies, indicators of compromise, and other potentially adverse events that may indicate that cybersecurity attacks and incidents are occurring. This Function supports successful incident response and recovery activities.

### Respond

The [Respond Core Function](/pages/respond/respond.md) helps ensure that actions regarding a detected cybersecurity incident are taken. Respond supports the ability to contain the effects of cybersecurity incidents. Outcomes within this Function cover incident management, analysis, mitigation, reporting, and communication.

### Recover

The Recover Core Function helps ensure that assets and operations affected by a cybersecurity incident are restored. Recover supports the timely restoration of normal operations to reduce the effects of cybersecurity incidents and enable appropriate communication during recovery efforts.

## History

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) was first introduced in 2014 in response to [Executive Order 13636](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/02/12/executive-order-improving-critical-infrastructure-cybersecurity), aimed at improving cybersecurity for critical infrastructure. It provided a flexible and scalable framework built around five core functions—Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover—and quickly gained widespread adoption due to its simplicity and adaptability. [CSF 1.1 was released in 2018](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/csf-11-archive) with minor updates, focusing on areas like identity management and supply chain risk, continuing to grow in popularity across sectors.

By 2022, the need for a major update was recognized due to emerging threats from technologies like IoT and cloud computing, leading to the development of NIST CSF 2.0. [Released in August 2023](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2023/08/nist-releases-20-cybersecurity-framework), CSF 2.0 introduced significant changes, including the addition of a sixth function, Govern, which focuses on integrating cybersecurity into business decision-making. It also expanded guidance for SMBs, strengthened supply chain risk management, and improved alignment with global cybersecurity frameworks, making it more accessible for a wider range of organizations.
