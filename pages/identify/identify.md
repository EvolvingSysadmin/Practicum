# Identify

## Summary

The [NIST CSF 2.0](/pages/framework/framework.md) Identify function is the foundation of the framework, focusing on understanding the organizational environment and the risks to its systems, people, assets, and data. This step helps organizations establish a comprehensive risk management strategy.

## Background

The organization’s current cybersecurity risks are understood. Understanding the organization’s assets (e.g., data, hardware, software, systems, facilities, services, people), suppliers, and related cybersecurity risks enables an organization to prioritize its efforts consistent with its risk management strategy and the mission needs identified under Govern. This Function also includes the identification of improvement opportunities for the organization’s policies, plans, processes, procedures, and practices that support cybersecurity risk management to inform efforts under all six Functions.
