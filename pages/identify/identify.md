# Identify

## Summary

The [NIST CSF 2.0](/pages/framework/framework.md) Identify function is the foundation of the framework, focusing on understanding the organizational environment and the risks to its systems, people, assets, and data. Policies related to the Identify function help organizations establish a comprehensive risk management strategy.

## Policy Templates

### Risk Assessment Policy

* **Description**: The Risk Assessment Policy ensures that Information Technology performs risk assessments in compliance with IT security policies, standards, and procedures.

* **Primary NIST CSF 2.0 Category**:: [Risk Assessment](#risk-assessment)

### Security Assessment and Authorization Policy

* **Description**: The Security Assessment and Authorization Policy establishes that Information Technology and the various business units (information owners) will ensure security controls in information systems, and the environments in which those systems operate, as part of initial and ongoing security authorizations, annual assessments, continuous monitoring and system development life cycle activities.
