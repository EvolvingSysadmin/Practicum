# Identify

Download free policy and standard templates for the [NIST CSF 2.0](/pages/framework/framework.md) Identify Core Function, which focuses on understanding the organizational environment and the risks to its systems, people, assets, and data. Policies related to the Identify function help organizations establish a comprehensive risk management strategy.

## Identify Function Background

## Identify Policy Templates

The following policy and standard templates help ensure that the NIST CSF Identify categories are adequately addressed, including [Asset Management](#asset-management); [Risk Assessment](#risk-assessment); and [Improvement](#improvement):

* [Risk Assessment Policy](#risk-assessment-policy)
* [Security Assessment and Authorization Policy](#security-assessment-and-authorization-policy)
* [Configuration Management Policy](#configuration-management-policy)
* [Secure Configuration Standard](#secure-configuration-standard)

Visit the [Template Usage](/pages/usage/template-usage.md) page for help completing these templates and the [Implementation Guide](/pages/implementation/implementation.md) page for tips on how to implement these policies and standards once the templates are completed.

### Risk Assessment Policy

* **Description**: The Risk Assessment Policy ensures that Information Technology performs risk assessments in compliance with IT security policies, standards, and procedures
* **Word Template Link**: [Risk-Assessment-Policy.docx](https://github.com/EvolvingSysadmin/Practicum/raw/refs/heads/main/templates/identify/Risk-Assessment-Policy.docx)
* **Primary NIST CSF 2.0 Category**:: [Risk Assessment](#risk-assessment)

### Security Assessment and Authorization Policy

* **Description**: The Security Assessment and Authorization Policy establishes that Information Technology and the various business units (information owners) will ensure security controls in information systems, and the environments in which those systems operate, as part of initial and ongoing security authorizations, annual assessments, continuous monitoring and system development life cycle activities.
* **Word Template Link**: [Security-Assessment-and-Authorization-Policy.docx](https://github.com/EvolvingSysadmin/Practicum/raw/refs/heads/main/templates/identify/Security-Assessment-and-Authorization-Policy.docx)
* **Primary NIST CSF 2.0 Category**:: [Risk Assessment](#risk-assessment)

### Configuration Management Policy

* **Description**: The Configuration Management Policy ensures that Information Technology resources are inventoried and configured in compliance with IT security policies, standards, and procedures.
* **Document Link**: [Configuration-Management-Policy.docx](https://github.com/EvolvingSysadmin/Practicum/raw/refs/heads/main/templates/identify/Configuration-Management-Policy.docx)
* **Primary NIST CSF 2.0 Category**: [Asset Management](#asset-management)

### Secure Configuration Standard

* **Description**: The Secure Configuration Standard establishes baseline configurations for information systems that are owned and/or operated by the entity. Effective implementation of this standard will maximize security and minimize the potential risk of unauthorized access to information and technology.
* **Document Link**: [Secure-Configuration-Standard.docx](https://github.com/EvolvingSysadmin/Practicum/raw/refs/heads/main/templates/identify/Secure-Configuration-Standard.docx)
* **Primary NIST CSF 2.0 Category**: [Asset Management](#asset-management)

### Secure System Development Life Cycle Standard

* **Description**: The Secure System Development Life Cycle Standard ensures that information security is adequately considered and built into every phase of the SDLC.  Failure to identify risks and implement proper controls can result in inadequate security, potentially putting entities at risk of data breaches, reputational exposure, loss of public trust, compromise to systems/networks, financial penalties and legal liability.
* **Document Link**: [Secure-System-Development-Life-Cycle-Standard.docx](https://github.com/EvolvingSysadmin/Practicum/raw/refs/heads/main/templates/identify/Secure-System-Development-Life-Cycle-Standard.docx)
* **Primary NIST CSF 2.0 Category**: [Asset Management](#asset-management)

### Maintenance Policy

* **Description**: The Maintenance Policy ensures that Information Technology resources are maintained in compliance with IT security policies, standards, and procedures.
* **Document Link**: [Maintenance-Policy.docx](https://github.com/EvolvingSysadmin/Practicum/raw/refs/heads/main/templates/identify/Maintenance-Policy.docx)
* **Primary NIST CSF 2.0 Category**: [Improvement](#improvement)

### Asset Management

* **Description**: Assets (e.g., data, hardware, software, systems, facilities, services, people) that enable the organization to achieve business purposes are identified and managed consistent with their relative importance to organizational objectives and the organization’s risk strategy
* **NIST CSF 2.0 Identifier**: ID.AM

### Risk Assessment

* **Description**:  The cybersecurity risk to the organization, assets, and individuals is understood by the organization
* **NIST CSF 2.0 Identifier**: ID.RA

### Improvement

* **Description**: Improvements to organizational cybersecurity risk management processes, procedures and activities are identified across all CSF Functions
* **NIST CSF 2.0 Identifier**: ID.IM
