# Recover

Download free policy and standard templates for the [NIST CSF 2.0](/pages/framework/framework.md) Recover Core Function that emphasizes the importance of restoring and maintaining normal operations after a cybersecurity incident. It ensures that organizations can quickly bounce back from disruptions.

## Recover Function Background

The Recover Function focuses on restoring assets and operations impacted by cybersecurity incidents to minimize disruption and enable the timely return to normal operations. It involves implementing recovery plans, leveraging backup systems, and coordinating communication during recovery efforts. This function ensures that systems, data, and services are efficiently restored, while also evaluating recovery effectiveness and identifying areas for improvement. By optimizing recovery processes, organizations can reduce downtime, limit damage, and strengthen resilience for future incidents.

## Recover Policy Templates

The following policy and standard templates help ensure that the NIST CSF Recover categories are adequately addressed, including [Incident Recovery Plan Execution](#incident-recovery-plan-execution) and [Incident Recovery Communication](#incident-recovery-communication):

* [Contingency Planning Policy](#contingency-planning-policy)

Visit [Template Instructions](/pages/instructions/instructions.md) for help completing these templates and the [Implementation Guide](/pages/implementation/implementation.md) for tips on how to implement these policies and standards once the templates are completed.

### Contingency Planning Policy

* **Description**: The Contingency Planning Policy ensure that normal Information Technology resources and information systems are available during times of disruption of services.
* **Document Link**: [Contingency-Planning-Policy.docx](https://github.com/EvolvingSysadmin/Practicum/raw/refs/heads/main/templates/recover/Contingency-Planning-Policy.docx)
* **Primary NIST CSF 2.0 Category**: [Incident Recovery Plan Execution](#incident-recovery-plan-execution)

## NIST CSF 2.0 Recover Categories
