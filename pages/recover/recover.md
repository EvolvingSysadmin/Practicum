# Recover

Download free policy and standard templates for the [NIST CSF 2.0](/pages/framework/framework.md) Recover Core Function that emphasizes the importance of restoring and maintaining normal operations after a cybersecurity incident. It ensures that organizations can quickly bounce back from disruptions.

## Recover Function Background

Assets and operations affected by a cybersecurity incident are restored. The Recover function supports the timely restoration of normal operations to reduce the effects of cybersecurity incidents and enable appropriate communication during recovery efforts.
