# Policy Template Overview

TODO: rewrite for clarity, provided more references/links, update instructions for how users can complete the docs, update link to combined templates doc.

## Background

These cybersecurity policy templates are pre-designed, editable documents that follow the high level Core Functions of the [NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework). These documents can be used by small businesses to establish their cybersecurity protocols and guidelines. These templates help streamline the creation of security policies by providing a structured format, key components, and best practices. They are essential for ensuring compliance, enhancing security posture, and facilitating a consistent approach to risk management. Utilizing cybersecurity policy templates is a strategic approach for organizations aiming to enhance their cybersecurity posture. By providing a structured framework, these templates simplify policy development and implementation, ensuring that all aspects of security are adequately addressed. Regular review and customization of these templates help organizations stay ahead of evolving cyber threats.

## Key Components

1. **Purpose Statement:** Outlines the objectives and importance of the policy.
2. **Scope:** Defines who the policy applies to and the systems or data it covers.
3. **Roles and Responsibilities:** Details the specific roles within the organization responsible for various security tasks.
4. **Policy Guidelines:** Provides the rules and procedures for maintaining security, including access controls, data handling, and incident response.
5. **Compliance and Enforcement:** States the consequences of non-compliance and the process for enforcement.
6. **Review and Revision Procedures:** Establishes how often the policy will be reviewed and updated.

## Implementation

* **Assess Organizational Needs:** Evaluate the specific risks and requirements of your organization to tailor the template accordingly.
* **Involve Stakeholders:** Engage relevant personnel, such as IT, HR, and legal teams, to ensure all perspectives are considered.
* **Align with Existing Policies:** Make sure the new policy complements and aligns with other organizational policies.
* **Review Regularly:** Establish a schedule for regular review and updates to keep the policy relevant and effective.

## Downloads

The free cybersecurity policy templates provided by this site can be [downloaded here as a single document](/templates/combined/to-contain-combined-templates.txt). They can also be downloaded as individual templates that are organized by the NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 core functions and available here:

* [**Identify**](/pages/identify/identify.md): Involves understanding and managing cybersecurity risks to systems, people, assets, data, and capabilities.
* [**Protect**](/pages/protect/protect.md): Develops and implements safeguards to limit or contain the impact of potential cybersecurity events.
* [**Detect**](/pages/detect/detect.md): Enables timely discovery of cybersecurity incidents by continuously monitoring systems and environments.
* [**Respond**](/pages/respond/respond.md): Guides how to effectively contain and manage the impacts of detected cybersecurity incidents.
* [**Recover**](/pages/recover/readme.md): Focuses on restoring capabilities and services after a cybersecurity incident to minimize disruption.

## Importance

Cybersecurity policy templates are crucial for several reasons:

* **Efficiency:** They save time and resources by providing a ready-made structure for organizations to adapt.
* **Consistency:** Templates ensure that policies are uniform across departments and teams, reducing gaps in security measures.
* **Compliance:** Many templates include considerations for legal and regulatory requirements, helping organizations meet their obligations.
* **Best Practices:** They often incorporate industry best practices, which can improve the overall effectiveness of the organization’s security measures.
