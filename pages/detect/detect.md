# Detect

The Detect function focuses on identifying the occurrence of a cybersecurity event in a timely manner. This involves continuous monitoring and assessment of systems to quickly spot anomalies and potential threats.

## Background

Possible cybersecurity attacks and compromises are found and analyzed. The Detect function enables the timely discovery and analysis of anomalies, indicators of compromise, and other potentially adverse events that may indicate that cybersecurity attacks and incidents are occurring. This Function supports successful incident response and recovery activities.
