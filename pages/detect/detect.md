# Detect

## Summary

The [NIST CSF 2.0](/pages/framework/framework.md) Detect core function focuses on identifying the occurrence of a cybersecurity event in a timely manner. This involves continuous monitoring and assessment of systems to quickly spot anomalies and potential threats.

## Background

Possible cybersecurity attacks and compromises are found and analyzed. The Detect function enables the timely discovery and analysis of anomalies, indicators of compromise, and other potentially adverse events that may indicate that cybersecurity attacks and incidents are occurring. This Function supports successful incident response and recovery activities.

## Policy Templates

### Auditing and Accountability Policy

* **Description**: The Auditing and Accountability Policy ensures that Information Technology resources and information systems are established with effective security controls and control enhancements that reflect applicable federal and state laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance.
* **Document Link**: [Auditing-and-Accountability-Policy.docx](https://github.com/EvolvingSysadmin/Practicum/raw/refs/heads/main/templates/detect/Auditing-and-Accountability-Policy.docx)
* **NIST CSF 2.0 Category**: [Continuous Monitoring](#continuous-monitoring)

### Secure Coding Standard

* **Description**: The Secure Coding Standard ensures that code written is resilient to high-risk threats and to avoid the occurrence of the most common coding errors which create serious vulnerabilities in software.  While it is impossible to write code that is completely impervious to all possible attacks, implementing these coding standards throughout information systems will significantly reduce the risk of disclosure, alteration or destruction of information due to software vulnerabilities.

* **NIST CSF 2.0 Category**: [Continuous Monitoring](#continuous-monitoring)

### Security Logging Standard

* **Description**: The Security Logging Standard defines requirements for security log generation, management, storage, disposal, access, and use. Security logs are generated by many sources, including security software, such as antivirus software, firewalls, and intrusion detection and prevention systems; operating systems on servers, workstations, and networking equipment; databases and applications.

* **NIST CSF 2.0 Category**: [Continuous Monitoring](#continuous-monitoring)

### Vulnerability Scanning Standard

* **Description**: The Vulnerability Scanning Standard establishes that vulnerabilities identified through scanning are tracked, evaluated, prioritized and managed until the vulnerabilities are remediated or otherwise appropriately resolved. Managing the vulnerabilities identified during scans ensures that appropriate actions are taken to reduce the potential that these vulnerabilities are exploited and thereby reduce risk of compromise to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information assets.

### Continuous Monitoring

* **Description**: Assets are monitored to find anomalies, indicators of compromise, and other potentially adverse events
* **NIST CSF 2.0 Identifier**: DE.CM

### Adverse Event Analysis

* **Description**: Anomalies, indicators of compromise, and other potentially adverse events are analyzed to characterize the events and detect cybersecurity incidents
* **NIST CSF 2.0 Identifier**: DE.AE

## Implementation Tasks

* **Anomalies and Events:** Monitor systems for unusual activity that may indicate a cyber threat.
* **Continuous Monitoring:** Utilize automated tools to provide real-time insights into the security posture of the organization.
* **Detection Processes:** Establish and maintain procedures for detecting cybersecurity incidents.
