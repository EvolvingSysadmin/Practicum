# Policy Template Usage

These cybersecurity policy templates are pre-designed, editable documents that follow the high level Core Functions of the [NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework). These templates can be used by small businesses to establish cybersecurity protocols and standards by providing a structured format, key components, and best practices.

## How to Use Templates for Your Organization

To use these templates for your organization, first download the relevant policy/standard Microsoft Word document from the corresponding core function page. Upon download, follow these steps to complete the templates and implement the policy/standard within your organization:

1. Click each bracketed field to input basic policy/standard information
2. Thoroughly review all 10 Policy Sections to ensure accuracy and alignment with existing organizational policies, procedures, and standards.
3. Input key term definitions that require clarification into Section 7.
4. Review related documents in Section 10.
5. Save the document and print the necessary pages to a PDF or printer.
6. Revisit this website, particularly the [implementation page](/pages/implementation/implementation.md), for further policy/standard creation and deployment resources.

## Template Policy Components

Each policy template is comprised of the following sections:

1. **Purpose and Benefits:** Outlines the role of risk management in safeguarding information security by identifying, analyzing, and maintaining risks at acceptable levels to align with business goals and regulatory mandates.
2. **Authority:** Establishes the policy’s enforcement authority under organizational management, guided by NIST's Cybersecurity Framework, ensuring enhanced cybersecurity practices.
3. **Scope:** Defines the policy’s applicability to all users of the organization's systems, requiring adherence to both this policy and the broader Information Security Policy.
4. **Information Statement:** Emphasizes the importance of ongoing risk management to identify and mitigate security risks, acknowledging that risk can be managed but not fully eliminated.
5. **Compliance:** Mandates immediate compliance with the policy and related standards upon publication, with processes for requesting exceptions if necessary.
6. **Policy Exceptions:** Details the procedure for requesting exceptions to the policy, including justification, risks, and proposed mitigations for approval by the authority.
7. **Definitions of Key Terms:** Provides a glossary of important terms used within the policy for clarity and consistency.
8. **Contact Information:** Lists the contact details for the policy owner, facilitating inquiries and requests for updates.
9. **Revision History:** Tracks changes made to the policy over time to ensure its ongoing relevance and effectiveness.
10. **Related Documents:** References important guidelines, such as NIST SP 800-30 and NIST SP 800-39, that support and guide the policy.

## Importance

These tampltes are essential for ensuring compliance, enhancing security posture, and facilitating a consistent approach to risk management. By providing a structured framework, these templates simplify policy development and implementation, ensuring that all aspects of security are adequately addressed. Regular review and customization of these templates help organizations stay ahead of evolving cyber threats while providing the following benefits:

* **Efficiency:** They save time and resources by providing a ready-made structure for organizations to adapt.
* **Consistency:** Templates ensure that policies are uniform across departments and teams, reducing gaps in security measures.
* **Compliance:** Many templates include considerations for legal and regulatory requirements, helping organizations meet their obligations.
* **Best Practices:** They often incorporate industry best practices, which can improve the overall effectiveness of the organization’s security measures.


## Implementation

The following implementation tasks should be undertaken after completion of the policy templates.

[This section to be expanded once policy template guides are completed]

* **Assess Organizational Needs:** Evaluate the specific risks and requirements of your organization to tailor the template accordingly.
* **Involve Stakeholders:** Engage relevant personnel, such as IT, HR, and legal teams, to ensure all perspectives are considered.
* **Align with Existing Policies:** Make sure the new policy complements and aligns with other organizational policies.
* **Review Regularly:** Establish a schedule for regular review and updates to keep the policy relevant and effective.
