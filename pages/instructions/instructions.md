# Policy Template Instructions

These 36 cybersecurity policy and standards templates are pre-designed, editable documents that follow the high level Core Functions of the [NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework). These templates can be used by small businesses to establish cybersecurity protocols and standards by providing a structured format, key components, and best practices.

## How to Use Templates for Your Organization

To use these templates for your organization, first download the relevant policy/standard Microsoft Word document from the corresponding core function page. Upon download, follow these steps to complete the templates and implement the policy/standard within your organization:

1. Click each bracketed field to input basic policy/standard information
2. Thoroughly review all 10 Policy Sections to ensure accuracy and alignment with existing organizational policies, procedures, and standards.
3. Input key term definitions that require clarification into Section 7.
4. Review related documents in Section 10.
5. Save the document and print the necessary pages to a PDF or printer.
6. Revisit this website, particularly the [implementation page](/pages/implementation/implementation.md), for further policy/standard creation and deployment resources.

## About These Templates

The templates available on this site are based on those provided by the State of New York and the State of California, through the [Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC)](https://www.cisecurity.org/ms-isac). MS-ISAC is a national organization that offers cybersecurity resources, threat intelligence, and collaborative support to help state, local, tribal, and territorial governments protect their information systems from cyber threats.

The [original templates](https://github.com/EvolvingSysadmin/Practicum/raw/refs/heads/main/resources/original-templates.zip) have been modified to better meet the needs of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), with improvements such as uniform formatting and the ability to update multiple sections simultaneously. These templates can, and should, also be customized further to align with an organization's specific policies.

Users should note that the templates may not reflect the latest NIST revisions and should be used as a starting point only. Additionally, these templates are not for commercial use or monetary gain by any organization. The templates are organized by NIST CSF 2.0 Core Function and are linked to primary NIST CSF Categories within the Core Functions. However, individual policies/standards may apply to multiple Categories across numerous Core Functions.

## Template Sections

Each template is comprised of the following sections:

1. **Purpose and Benefits:** Explains the overall goal of the policy and outlines the benefits of the policy.
2. **Authority:** Establishes the policy’s enforcement authority under organizational management to ensure alignment with best practices. It designates the responsible parties for implementation and enforcement.
3. **Scope:** Defines the individuals and entities that must comply with the policy. It sets the boundaries of the policy and ensures clarity on who is impacted, covering all types of users, devices, and data across the organization.
4. **Information Statement:** Specifies the core objectives and mechanisms of the policy, including the implementation of specific controls and processes.
5. **Compliance:** Mandates the effective date of the policy and the expectation of compliance across the organization. It notes that policies may be amended, and adherence to updated policies is required.
6. **Policy Exceptions:** Details the procedure for requesting exceptions to the policy, including justification, risks, and proposed mitigations for approval by the authority.
7. **Definitions of Key Terms:** Provides a glossary of important terms used within the policy for clarity and consistency.
8. **Contact Information:** Lists the contact details for the policy owner, facilitating inquiries and requests for revisions.
9. **Revision History:** Tracks changes made to the policy over time to ensure its ongoing relevance and effectiveness.
10. **Related Documents:** References important guidelines, primarily those provided by NIST, that support and guide the policy.

## Importance

These tampltes are essential for ensuring compliance, enhancing security posture, and facilitating a consistent approach to risk management. By providing a structured framework, these templates simplify policy development and implementation, ensuring that all aspects of security are adequately addressed. Regular review and customization of these templates help organizations stay ahead of evolving cyber threats while providing the following benefits:

* **Efficiency:** They save time and resources by providing a ready-made structure for organizations to adapt.
* **Consistency:** Templates ensure that policies are uniform across departments and teams, reducing gaps in security measures.
* **Compliance:** Many templates include considerations for legal and regulatory requirements, helping organizations meet their obligations.
* **Best Practices:** They often incorporate industry best practices, which can improve the overall effectiveness of the organization’s security measures.
