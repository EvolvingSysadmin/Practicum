## Summary

The [NIST CSF 2.0](/pages/framework/framework.md) Respond core function outlines the activities necessary to take action regarding a detected cybersecurity incident. It focuses on ensuring an effective response to minimize impact and recover quickly.

## Background

Actions regarding a detected cybersecurity incident are taken. The Respond function supports the ability to contain the effects of cybersecurity incidents. Outcomes within this Function cover incident management, analysis, mitigation, reporting, and communication.

## Policy Templates

### Computer Security Threat Response Policy

* **Description**: The Computer Security Threat Response Policy defines then responsibility in responding to security threats affecting the confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability of information technology resources.
* **Document Link**: [Computer-Security-Threat-Response-Policy.docx](https://github.com/EvolvingSysadmin/Practicum/raw/refs/heads/main/templates/respond/Computer-Security-Threat-Response-Policy.docx)
* **NIST CSF 2.0 Category**: [Incident Response Reporting and Communication](#incident-response-reporting-and-communication)

### Cyber Incident Response Standard

* **Description**: The Cyber Incident Response Standard outlines the general steps for responding to computer security incidents.  In addition to providing a standardized process flow, it identifies the incident response takeholders and establishes their roles and responsibilities; describes incident triggering sources, incident types, and incident severity levels; and includes requirements for annual testing, post-incident lessons-learned activities, and collection of Incident Rresponse metrics for use in gauging IR effectiveness.

* **NIST CSF 2.0 Category**: [Incident Response Reporting and Communication](#incident-response-reporting-and-communication)

### Incident Response Policy

* **Description**: The Incident Response Policy ensures that Information Technology properly identifies, contains, investigates, remedies, reports, and responds to computer security incidents.

## NIST 2.0 Categories

### Incident Management

* **Description**: Responses to detected cybersecurity incidents are managed
* **NIST CSF 2.0 Identifier**: RS.MA

### Incident Analysis

* **Description**:  Investigations are conducted to ensure effective response and support forensics and recovery activities
* **NIST CSF 2.0 Identifier**: RS.AN

### Incident Response Reporting and Communication

* **Description**: Response activities are coordinated with internal and external stakeholders as required by laws, regulations, or policies
* **NIST CSF 2.0 Identifier**: RS.CO

### Incident Mitigation

* **Description**:  Activities are performed to prevent expansion of an event and mitigate its effects
* **NIST CSF 2.0 Identifier**: RS.MI

## Key Implementation Tasks

* **Response Planning:** Develop and maintain an incident response plan that outlines roles, responsibilities, and procedures.
* **Communications:** Ensure clear communication with stakeholders during and after an incident, including regulatory bodies if necessary.
* **Analysis:** Investigate incidents to understand their cause and impact, facilitating improved future responses.
* **Mitigation:** Implement actions to contain and eradicate threats from systems.

## Benefits

* Reduced impact of cybersecurity incidents.
* Enhanced organizational learning and improvement.
