* Go through: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.1300.pdf

* Potential:
  * Mention that some of the policies cross over to different core functions
  * Go back through category mapping/consider new policies
  * Rewrite scope
  * How to demonstrate compliance with these policies
  * Links to implementation guides within instructions (can be to blank doc initially)

* What I'd do different:
  * Get feedback on policy templates sooner
  * Centralized content to make editing docs less tedious


* Site
  * Add docs from resources into pages
  * Add collaborations page/instructions and mention on homepage
  * Add references that correspond with policy related documents
  * Mention that some of the policies cross over to different core functions
* Ancillary tasks
  * Create PDFs
  * Review category mapping

* Finish page content for each core function
  * Reassess benefits/implementation tasks
  * Ensure content is well written and edited
* Create implementation guides, including CSF profiles, enforcement actions, exemptions
  * Add links from template pages
* Suggest different policy packages depending on profile/tier?
